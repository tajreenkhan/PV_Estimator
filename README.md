# PV_Estimator

Solar PV Estimator is web based tool to estimate the amount of electricity that can be generated from a grid Photovoltaic 
system and its carbon savings at any location in the world.

Methodology:
The energy predictions calculated by Classlesoft PV Estimator include many inherent assumptions. For understanding the 
followed methodology and underlying assumptions, please refer this document (currently unavailable). The scope of the project
is just to give an idea on how the performance of Photovoltaic system varies with location and configuration. 
Future work include, ability to compare performance of systems at two different locations simultaneously, suggest optimum tilt 
angles for desired location, cost and economic analysis.
